This post is a very basic overview of what smart phones are useful for. Go ahead and get started!

# 1. Letterboxes
Your phone is a letterbox... for digital packages. An SMS or WhatsApp message you send is smaller, like a letter or a card, a
Paytm or Google Pay payment is also small, like a money order. Images and videos are bigger, like packages. 
You can send letters and packages, but you can also receive them. When you watch Youtube , or receive an SMS, the creator of the video/SMS is 'posting' their package in your letterbox, i.e. your phone. 

Your phone isn't just a letterbox, it's also a storage room, for all your digital packages. You can use it to store packages you receive and also to store those packages you create, perhaps to be sent at a later date.

# 2. Apps
Apps help you send and receive packages, cards, telegrams, money orders, or even bigger packages. There are many types of packages, and hence there are many types of apps. You choose an app depending on the type of package you want to send or receive and also depending on whether the receiver you wish to reach has the same app. When you want to send/receive messages or images or videos,you may use WhatsApp or Gmail or Social media. To make calls you don't need an app, but if you wish to make a video call, the WhatsApp, Google Meet, or Zoom is useful. If you wish to send/receive money or pay a bill you may use BHIM or Paytm or Google Pay.<br>
In some cases you just want to read the news. The newspaper may not come to your doorstep anymore, but you can find them using a
search App like Chrome or Firefox. If you need directions to an address you can use the Google Maps app. If you need to get a cab or auto to get to that address you can use the Ola app or Uber. <br>
Apps aren't only useful when you want to send and receive packages of information. Apps also help you create material, that you can store on your phone. When you want to create a report, you can use the Docs app, or if you want to create a spreadsheet, you can use a Sheets app. If you want to create a survey form you can use Google Forms, or Open Data Kit. If you need more space than the space on your phone, you can use the Drive App or Dropbox , which are storage boxes which store your packages, a few packages for free, but charging a fee for many packages.<br>

# 3. Understanding recharges - data, calling and sms
Understanding data is far more important nowadays than calling or sms. An android phone only proves useful if it has a data (internet) connection. You can think of data as currency you use when you send and receive digital packages. Purchasing a mobile data plan gives you some amount of data that you can use within a certain period of time (validity period). Data is specified as KB which is much smaller than MB, which is much smaller than GB. Most messages are less than a KB, photos are generally less than an MB or sometimes more, videos are very often larger than 10MB. A data pack that offers 1 GB/day will suffice for most of your needs, but you may require more if you are a heavy user. Alternatively, if you wish to use your android phone only for calls you can select mobile plans that offer only calling & SMS but no data (internet).

# 4. Network or WiFi
Once we have an understanding of data, we must understand the two ways of enabling data on an android phone. The first is using the phone's data network and the second is through WiFi/dongle. The data network must be used more sparingly than WiFi. WiFi is a large lake and the data network is a large tank. While using data from the data network can more than suffice for moderate users, for heavy users, WiFi is indispensable. Look for symbols shown below

Now that we have an idea of the basic concepts of smart phones in the next post we will learn navigation on an android phone.
