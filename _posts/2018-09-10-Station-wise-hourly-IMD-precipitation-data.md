# In Brief
The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) which has for long refrained from openly publishing its station-wise precipitation data is now doing so.
I recently came across their new web app: [http://aws.imd.gov.in/](http://aws.imd.gov.in/), which allows users to select a state and view a
table of hourly precipitation for all stations in the state. Preview can be seen in Fig.1 below.

The user interface is very intuitive and gives a smooth experience overall. The data itself doesn't take too long to load. A version of this
web app was also available more than 2 years ago, after which it was taken down. That however had a much less user friendly, slower interface.
