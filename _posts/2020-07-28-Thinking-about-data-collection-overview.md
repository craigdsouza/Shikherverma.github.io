# 1. The bigger picture
Data collection should be closely connected with the purpose of an organization and it's programmes and should evolve with it.
Often in practice however these two get de-linked. Surveys are developed for data collection based on templates that
are at hand. Finally when data analysis is undertaken to understand impact the mismatch is evident. Hence, foremost, 
adequate thought should go into the articulation of purpose/goals. Staff within the organization, from head to field persons,
must understand and agree on these.

# 2. Goals are not enough, we need outcomes and indicators
If my goal is to shorten my travel time, I must determine an outcome that will lead to the desired goal. An outcome is chosen, 
wherein prior research indicates a causal link between outcome and goal. One outcome that could lead there is to build a faster car. 
It's possible in this case to directly measure progress towards the goal (i.e. travel time in minutes/hours) or indirectly by 
measuring progress on the outcome (i.e. speed of car in mph). 
There is little debate on what the indicators for progress could be.<br>

If my goal however is to improve a community's health, it's far from certain how to measure progress. Perhaps, 'prevalence of illness' is one indicator.
Or number of sick days per month? However these indicators are comparatively difficult to measure compared to indicators of having achieved an outcome. 
In this case for instance, an outcome could be better sleep, or better nutrition, both of which are strongly correlated with good health. Indicators for
having achieved these outcomes could be a score on a sleep survey, or medical tests to determine the effect of nutrition, e.g. Hb test to measure
progress towards lower iron deficiency. In some cases, direct measurement of the indicator is not possible, in which case a proxy is measured, 
for instance, here 'the percentage of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for iron' being met.

# 3. Surveys
Once indicators are established we think about systematic surveys to capture the effect of outcomes. Surveys can be developed from scratch , 
but in many cases, especially for themes that are well studied, pre-developed and validated surveys are readily available.
If such surveys don't readily exist, one has to carefully consider the data points to be collected. Besides capturing just the indicators,
surveys should also collect explanatory variables or variations in the population. These could vary depending on the goal, however some common
data points are age, gender, weight and any data that captures variation in the application of the intervention. For instance this could be 
whether school attendance is poor, which could explain low Hb levels, since the child in question would miss their mid-day meal and RDA for iron.

# 4. Technical considerations
A brief note on technical considerations is given here. However these will be elaborated on in a separate article.

Surveyors may still choose to use paper surveys. Even if this is the case, it is beneficial to use tabular formats to capture responses and structured notations
to indicate choice of an answer. These responses can then more easily be recorded in digital formats using OCR technologies than if the paper format was ad hoc

If the choice is to go for digital data entry, a few main points should be taken into consideration.

# 5. Training of Surveyors
The first step in training surveyors is ensuring that the objective of the survey is well understood. Beyond this it is important to ensure appropriate
training in how to approach survey respondents and ask survey questions. A good guide on the subject is given here. A few simple pointers to keep in mind
would be
- sampling criteria should be well understood, see next section
- approach respondents with courtesy
- introduce oneself/organization and purpose of visit
- check if potential respondent meets eligibility criteria
- check their time availability and obtain consent for survey
- Stick as close to the given wording as possible, avoiding leading questions
- ensure each question is well understood, translating to another language or elaborating on the meaning as necessary
- ensure enough time for respondent to reply, avoiding prompting a response
- remind them that "no response" or "don't know" is always an option.
- if survey is long in nature take a break as necessary
- if survey requires medical measurements, ensure satisfying criteria are met
- ensure contact details are obtained if the survey is longitudinal in nature


# 6. Sampling
Sampling starts with determination of the unit for making an assessment. For example, the unit of the respondent may be a household or individual.
However the unit of assessment/ study may be district level/block level/ neighborhood level and so on. Ideally a 'sampling frame' must be obtained.

* I'm writing this piece based on my experience working with non-profits in the development sector and research on the subject. 
My experience and research has been limited to quantitative data collection to understand impact, qualitative data hasn't been covered here, 
but I welcome inputs from others who would like to co-write something on qualitative data.
