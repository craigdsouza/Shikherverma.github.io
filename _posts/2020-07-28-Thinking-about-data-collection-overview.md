* I'm writing this piece based on my experience working with non-profits in the development sector. This experience has been limited
to quantitative data collection to understand impact, qualitative data hasn't been covered here, but I welcome inputs from others who
would like to co-write something on qualitative data. 

# 1. The bigger picture
Data collection should be closely connected with the purpose of an organization and it's programmes and should evolve with it.
Often in practice however these two get de-linked. Surveys are developed for data collection based on templates that
are at hand. Finally when data analysis is undertaken to understand impact the mismatch is evident. Hence, foremost, 
adequate thought should go into the articulation of purpose/goals. Staff within the organization, from head to field persons,
must understand and agree on these.

# 2. Goals are not enough, we need outcomes and indicators
If my goal is to build a faster car, it's evident that the indicator is km/h or mph. There is consensus on what the indicator
for speed is. If my goal however is to improve a community's health, it's far from certain what outcome will lead to the desired result. 
An outcome is specified wherein prior research indicates a causal link between outcome and goal. In this case for instance,
an outcome could be reducing the prevalence of iron deficiency in a community's children. From an outcome , an indicator (sometimes called a 'measure') emerges, 
which in this case could simply be blood Haemoglobin (Hb) levels. In some cases, direct measurement of the indicator is not possible,
in which case a proxy is measured, for instance, here 'the percentage of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for iron' being met. 

# 3. Surveys
Once indicators are established we think about systematic surveys to capture the effect of outcomes.
Surveys can be developed from scratch , but in many cases, especially for themes that are well studied, pre-developed and validated surveys are readily available.
If such surveys don't readily exist, one has to carefully consider the data points to be collected. Besides capturing just the indicators,
surveys should also collect explanatory variables or variations in the population. These could vary depending on the goal, however some common
data points are age, gender, weight and any data that captures variation in the application of the intervention. For instance this could be 
whether school attendance is poor, which could explain low Hb levels, since the child in question would miss their mid-day meal and RDA for iron.
