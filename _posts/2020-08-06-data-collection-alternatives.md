Let's first understand what data collection platforms consist of before winnowing them down as per our requirements
1. form/survey builders
  - form validation
2. data collection app
3. data storage
4. data visualization

1. form/survey builders
software that helps create surveys falls under this category. some platforms have dedicated software for this functionality,
this enables users to create forms offline, whereas others simply use your web browser for the same, which requires an active
internet connection. 
Survey templates is another feature that some platforms provide, where you don't start from scratch and can simply use externally 
benchmarked and validated surveys.
