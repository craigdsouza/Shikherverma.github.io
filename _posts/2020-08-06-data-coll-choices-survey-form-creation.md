Data collection platforms consist of multiple components
1. form/survey builders
- form validation
2. data collection app
3. data storage
4. data visualization

In this post we will cover form/survey builders, and do a detailed comparison of four major alternatives, ODK, Kobo, Google Forms, and Survey Monkey.

# 1. An overview of the features of form builders
software that helps create surveys falls under the category of form builders. Listed here are some core features, each of which is explained in
further detail in sections below. 
- **Desktop/Web** : Some platforms have dedicated desktop software for form creation, this enables users to create forms offline, whereas others 
simply use your web browser for the same, which requires an active internet connection. 
- **Question types**: this include the basics, from text and numeric input to more advanced such as barcode input or image/audio input. 
___ has the most variety while __ has the least.
- **Metadata questions**: such as start, end times, userid, deviceid, etc fall under metadata questions.
- **Form logic**: is a set of rules for whether or not a question should be displayed based on responses to previous questions.
- **Response validation**: is the application of custom rules to each question being asked to ensure the response is a valid response.
- **Question grouping**: this allows a set of questions to be treated uniformly by other features, such as form logic or form styling.
- **Repeat questions**: is a feature that allows certain questions to be repeated any number of times, depending on answers given at the 
time of form submission.
- **Dynamic calculations**: this feature allows values to be used in questions that are dynamically calculated during form entry,
based on responses to previous form questions. 
- **Survey templates**: is another feature that some platforms provide, where you don't start from scratch and can simply use externally 
benchmarked and validated surveys. In the absence of fully ready-to-use survey templates, tools such as Kobo Form Builder offers a 
substitute feature , 'question libraries'.
- **Form styling**: this feature allows forms to be styled in different ways depending on data collector's preferences.
- **Multi-lingual support**: this feature allows the same form to be created in multiple language formats for different audiences.
