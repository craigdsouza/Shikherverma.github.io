			Welcome! <br />
			My page however I can tell you has posts on work I do, right now mostly under the themes
			'tech-how-tos','data-how-tos', 'scraping', 'gis', 'remote-sensing' and some ideas/concepts in development
			that I'm excited about! I also don't draw a strong distinction between professional & personal,
			and hence this blog will evolve to include a lot more personal over time. The pandemic has
			made me realise a virtual presence is vital, to pay the bills as well as to sustain connections.
			Moreover I've	always been energized by collaborations and communities. Do leave feedback on anything you find useful!
			</p>
		<p>
			The website is still in development! Majority of content can be found under <a href="/blog">'Blog'</a> and planned content can be found under 'Themes' right now. I'm using <a href="https://trello.com/b/8Z74rwG7/craigdsouzagithubio" target="_blank">To Do lists on Trello</a> to plan.
			Feel free to leave your input there on future blogposts or suggest new ones.<br />
			<b>Especially if you're doing interesting work</b>, (i'm biased towards the natural & social sciences) and you need any technical help, feel free to email me at craigds022@gmail.com. Working on projects is added motivation for me to learn.
