description: Worked within a team of 4 in the Datameet Pune chapter (July 2017 to June 2018) to develop tools for easy access to water data. You can visit the project <a href="https://datameet-pune.github.io/open-water-data/" target="_blank">website</a> for more details. Our main outputs were a resource paper on open water datasets and a web app for open access precipitation data.
